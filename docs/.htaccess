# Rewrite www.example.com â†’ example.com

# The same content should never be available under two different
# URLs, especially not with and without `www.` at the beginning.
# This can cause SEO problems (duplicate content), and therefore,
# you should choose one of the alternatives and redirect the other
# one.
#
# (!) NEVER USE BOTH WWW-RELATED RULES AT THE SAME TIME!

# (1) The rule assumes by default that both HTTP and HTTPS
#     environments are available for redirection.
#     If your SSL certificate could not handle one of the domains
#     used during redirection, you should turn the condition on.
